        <h2>Introduction.</h2>
        <p>
          A website (also written as a web site) is a collection of web pages
          and related content that is identified by a common domain name and
          published on at least one web server. Websites are typically dedicated
          to a particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, commerce,
          entertainment, or social media. Hyperlinking between web pages guides
          the navigation of the site, which often starts with a home page. The
          most-visited sites are Google, YouTube, and Facebook.
        </p>
        <p>
          All publicly-accessible websites collectively constitute the World
          Wide Web. There are also private websites that can only be accessed on
          a private network, such as a company's internal website for its
          employees. Users can access websites on a range of devices, including
          desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The app used on these
          devices is called a web browser.

        <h2>HyperText Markup Languange (HTML).</h2>
        <img
          width="100px"
          src="./assets/img/HTML5_logo_and_wordmark.svg.png"
          alt="html"
        />
        <p>
          HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for
          documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the
          content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by
          technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
          languages such as JavaScript. see
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the definition above, we know that HTML is a standard markup
          language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser and
          it defines the content and <mark>structure</mark> of web content. see
          the marked word 'structure', HTML is smiliar to a mannequin where we
          can put on a clothes, or maybe a sunglasses, but basically html is
          just a Mannequin.

        <h2>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).</h2>
        <img
          src="./assets/img/CSS3_logo_and_wordmark.svg.png"
          alt="CSS"
          width="70px"
        />
        <p>
          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
          specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a
          markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as
          SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World
          Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. see
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the CSS definitions above we can draw conclusions, CSS is used
          for styling our HTML documents, its the same as we put a clothes or
          sunglasses in a Mannequin to make them looks good.
